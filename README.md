# **Real-Time Dashboard** by Felipe Moreira

### Overview

A React-based dashboard that visualizes real-time sensor data (temperature, humidity, and pressure) using a simulated API. Built with React, TypeScript, and Recharts, the dashboard is fully responsive and includes configurable widgets, error handling, and bonus features like a combined graph with toggleable data types.

### Features

- Real-Time Data: Displays live sensor data with dynamic updates.
- Configurable Widgets: Enable/disable widgets for temperature, humidity, and pressure.
- Side Panel: Adjust the real-time interval (1s to 9s) and toggle widgets.
- Error Handling: Simulates API errors and displays notifications.
- Bonus:
  - Configurable time range for graphs (1min, 5min, 10min).
  - Combined widget with toggleable temperature and humidity data.
